## General Info

Veisla (Banquet in Icelandic), is a meals library/browser that provides plenty of options of recipes of various types, ingredients and sources, coming from many places around the world.

----------

### The Idea

The project is a the result of a my self-taught journey aroung Vue.js and Front-End Development in general.

### On Going functionalities

Currently, you can only do simple, individual search around the [MealsDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php), limiting the user's search to only one ingredient at a time (the project utilizes the free version of it, which is good but limiting in some other aspects).
In the future the user will be able to filter it's research more efficiently by providing multiple ingredient search, as well filter it's options by popularity or receive suggestions randomly.

----------

## Technologies

Veisla currently uses:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev);
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org);
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com).

As well:

- Axios;
- Vue-Router;
- [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/docs).

For the search results, as said above, the project uses the free version of the [MealsDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

----------

## Launch

To run VEISLA on your machine, first make sure to have NPM and Vite installed.

Download the project and unzip it to your prefered folder, cd into the folder in your terminal, then install the dependencies:

```bash
cd veisla/
npm install
```

Then:

```bash
vite
```

After that follow the port informed in your terminal in your prefered browser, and Voil√†, or should I say Veisla?

Just like this:

```bash
  VITE v4.2.1  ready in 1337 ms

  -  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
